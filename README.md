# Aim
_In this work, we explored women participation in ecology conferences by using the 1st Meeting of the Iberian Society of Ecology (SIBECOL, www.sibecol.org) as a testing ground. Specifically, we aimed to assess if women and men were equally represented, participative and visible, and if not, to what extent these differences were due to demographic inertia or to other non-recognized aspects._

# Code

To answer the abovementioned questions, we compiled and analized data in three main blocks using three indpendent R scripts: 

- __`GenderSibecol_Block1.R`__: to analyze the participation of women in the attendance, speakers and organization panels.
- __`GenderSibecol_Block2.R`__: to analyze the audience behavior during Q&A times.
- __`GenderSibecol_Block3.R`__: to analyze the the perception of the attendees on women participation and visibility, gender barriers, and conference environment.

These analyses are critical to detect the mechanisms driving gender bias in academic conferences, and to develop evidence-based policymaking promoting inclusive scientific conferences for female researchers.

For a detailed explanation of the methods, please see the methods section of the main manuscript.
